# Figma UI Projects
Welcome to my collection of Figma UI projects! This repository showcases various user interface designs that I have created.

### Bayyen - بيّن
Our Quranthon project secured a spot among the top 20 out of 250 globally. We introduced an AI and gamification-driven solution to enhance Quran learning for individuals with hearing loss. 🌐💡

### Company Page Design
This design is for a company page that showcases the business, its services, and contact information. It features straightforward sections like Home, About Us, Services, and Contact, allowing visitors to easily learn about the company and get in touch. The design is clean and user-friendly, ensuring a smooth navigation experience.


### Raqeeb - رقيب
This project is a UI design for a web app that helps event organizers manage crowds at indoor events. Using cameras, the app tracks visitors, shows real-time crowd updates, and alerts organizers about crowded areas. The dashboard provides easy-to-read visuals and insights into visitor behavior, like movement patterns and time spent in each area. After the event, it generates reports to help improve future planning. The design focuses on making crowd management simple and efficient.


### Wasil - واصل
This project was designed during the Jahez Hackathon, where we introduced the idea of simplifying group orders. The solution allows users to easily share their shopping cart with friends, split the payment seamlessly, and track the order status together, addressing the challenges of coordination, joint payment, and real-time order updates.
