# Raqeeb - رقيب

This project is a UI design for a web app that helps event organizers manage crowds at indoor events. Using cameras, the app tracks visitors, shows real-time crowd updates, and alerts organizers about crowded areas. The dashboard provides easy-to-read visuals and insights into visitor behavior, like movement patterns and time spent in each area. After the event, it generates reports to help improve future planning. The design focuses on making crowd management simple and efficient.
